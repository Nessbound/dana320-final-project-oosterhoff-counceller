# dana320-final-project-oosterhoff-counceller
Our final project for the DANA320 class at Ball State University.

## Data source
Our data source is the data-music.RData provided for the project. This data set is a collection of the statistics of about 160,000 songs on Spotify, including things like their danceability and artist who made them.

## Project Structure
- Data Folder
    - This folder contains our data-music.RData file, needed as the data source for the project.
- Design Documents
    - This folder contains pictures of our goofy lil drawings for our project, so that we have them for reference while working.
- Individual Pages
    - This folder contains the code for the original pages that we worked on seperately, before they were combined into complete.r.
- QuartoTesting
    - This folder contains the testing.qmd file and its components. This was mainly used by Noah since it was an easy way to figure out the dataset, data transformations, and graphs before diving into shiny.
- complete.r
    - This is the file that is run to display our project. Simply run it using whatever you run R files with, and it will display our project. Have fun checking out the data, there's some fun stuff you can figure out with the application! :)
